How could you promise love to me,
And not thot promise keep?

Why did you swesr mine eyes were br
Yet leave those 'eyes to weep?

How could you say, my lip was sweet‚
And made the scariot pale?

And why did 1, young witless maid,
Believe the flatt'ring tale?

Thai face, alas! no more is fain
That lip no longer red ;

Dork are mine eyes, now closed in dea
And ev’ry charin is fled.

The hungry worm my sister is;
This winding-sheet 1 wear;

And oold and weary lasts our night,
Til] thot lost morn appear.

But hnrk! the cook has warn’d me hen
A long ond last adieu i

Come see, false mani how low she lies
That died for iove of you.

Now birds did sing, and morning smile
And show her glittering head:
Pais Wiiiiam shook in every iimo,
Then taving lest his bed.
