TRAMLATED ΒΥ ΜΒ. 8. WESLEY.

Is, friend, u wife you meon to wod
Worthy oi your hosrd und hed,

That she he vinnons, be your oure,
Not too rich, ond not too fuir:

One who nor lohours to display

· Now complexions every day,

Nor, studying artificisl grace,
Out oi boues culls s face.

Nor livelong hours ior dressiug sparos,
Phoing, to displice, her hairs,

And straight repluoe; uu idle pin
Ten times shiiting out and in.

Nor daily varies, voinly uice,
Thrioe her silks, und colours thricoz

Fond o'er und o'er her suits to range,
Chunging still, and still to change.

Nor gods to psy, with husy air,
'l'rifliug visits here and there;

Long rapping ot euch door aloud,
Nuisanoe to o neighbourhood.

li e’er u play she deign to see,
(Very rsrely shall it be,)
