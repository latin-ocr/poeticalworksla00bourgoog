THE WREATH.

Come, and invest
Her snony breast,

Corne, bind her flowing hain
Like Flora’s dress

Be Phyllis's; q
Like Flore she is fair.

But little 'dures
Whote'er, ye flowerS,
Whate’er, ye herbe, ean give;
Nor shall your oid
Long grece the maid,
Nor have you long to live.

Α little while

Your glories smile, ’
Α little, little reign;

The sun, thet warine

Your opening eharmS,
Ost sees them olose again.

Or if they stay
Another day,
And yet another sun 3·
Then eomes a blaze
Of fieteei tayo,
They wither nno nte gone.
