THE THRACIAN.

TRANSLATED ΒΥ W. commu, ESQ.

Tflhhclhh' parents, at his birth,
Mourn their habe with many atear,
But, with undissembled mirth,
Place him breathless on his bier.

Greece and Rome, with scoth,

“ 0 the savages !'’ exclahm,

“ Whether they rejoice or mouth,
“ weh eutitled to the name !''

But the cause of this concern,

And this measure, would they hace,
Eveh they might somewhat learn

From the savages of Thrace.
