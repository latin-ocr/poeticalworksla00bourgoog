ΝΟ SORROW PECULIAR TO THE
SUFFERER.

mmmm) ΒΥ wuuAu GOWPER, 1¹:80.

Tun lover, in melodious verses,
His singular distress rehearses,

Still closing with a ruesul cry,

‘⁸ Was ever such a wretch as 1?”
Yes 1 thousands have endured before
All thy distress3 some, haply more.
Unnumber’d Corydons complain,
And Strephons‚ of the like disdain:
And if thy Chloe be os steel‚

Τοο deas to hear, too hard to seel;
Not her alone that censure fits,

Nor thou alone hast lost thy wits.

PHOEBE ORNATRIX.

mm ad speculum longas dum conterit horas,
omprimat ut positas justior ordo comas;

ra a sectetis J'uxta stat seduhx mma,
dominae laudes officiosa suaez
