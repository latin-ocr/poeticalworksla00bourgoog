Tho' shorter lines her fix'd dominious bino,

Her floating empire stretohes unconflned.

From Thetis' stores, and not her neighbours’ spoils.

She draws het treasure, fruit oi honest tuiis.

Rome saok'd‚ and plunder’d; Britain clothes tud
feeds;

Aequires their siches, but supplies their needs.

Sweet seat of freedomi be thy happier doom,
To 'soape the fate, as well as guiit of Rome:
Where riot, offspring oi unwieidy store.

Enerv'd those arms, that snatoh'd the spoil beiorm
With costly cates she stain’d her frugal board,

Then with ill-gotten gold she bought a iord.
Corruption, discord, luxury combined,
Down sunh the far-samed mistress oi mankind. ²

Hear, righteous prinoei Ο hear us loud invohe
Thy worth unblernish’d, to avent this stroke:
Yourself so free from ev’ry luwless visu,

You source admit the homage that is due.

Let other monarcho, with invasive bands,

Lessen their people‚ and extend their lunds;

By gasping nations hated and obey'd,

Lords of the¹ deserts, that their sword has made;
For thee kind heav’n a nobier tash ammuh.

To rix thy empire on thy peouies minda
