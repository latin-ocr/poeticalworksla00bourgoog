With her bright innoeence shall go,
Purer than the falling snow:

Quiet, that fer from quarrels flies; ⁵
Mirth and pleneme, love and joys:

Firm saith, that plighted promise hee·
Silence watching o’er her lips:

Prudenee‚ that ponders all events
Wealth-inereasing diligence:

Religion, mindful what is owed
To herself and to her God.

Petient to bear, to parden free,
Loveliest grace, humanityl

lt ersing nature chance to fail,
Feeble‚ inadvertent‚ ireil:

Who hstes low-whisper'd spite conc:
Scandal yet to few reveal'd;

Since enyy makes, with rumour¹dlies
Friends and brethren enemies.

Good-breeding shall her handmaid be
Join’d with ehaste-look’d modesty;

While open heart, and hand, and iae
Hospitality displays.

lf e’er Melissa grace your home,
These attendants with her come.

Whate'er can good or ill befell
Faithful pertner she of all.

Whose wisdom, teaching well to be
Soothes the bitterness oi este,

Whose Joy, is prosp'rous lete sunni

Adds new sweetness to the ΨΜ
