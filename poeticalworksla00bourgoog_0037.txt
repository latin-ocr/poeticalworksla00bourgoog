um THE nasu.

rr.
When in the slipp’ry paths of youth

With heedless steps I ran,
Thine arm unseen convey'd me safe,

And led me up to man.
vrr.

Through hidden dangers, toils, and deaths,
It gently cleared my way,
And through the pleusing snares of viee,
More to be fear’d than they.
vrrr.
When worn with siekness‚ oft hast thou '
With health renew'd my faee;
And when in sins aud sorrows sunk,
Reviv'd my soul with grace.
rx.
Thy bounteous hand, with worldly bliss,
Has made my cup run o'er;
And in ahiud and faithful friend
Has doubted all my sture.
x.
Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My daily thanis employ;
Nor is the least a oheerfui beart,
That tastes those gifts with joy.
xr.
Through ev'ry period of my life,
Thy goodness l’ll pursue;
And after death, in distant worlds,
The glorious themo renow.
