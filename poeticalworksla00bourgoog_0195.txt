STRADA’S NIGHTINGALE.

Tunnstn'rsn ΒΥ wisunt( cowrssn, 8800

Tun shepherd touch’d his reed; sweet Philomel
Essay’d‚ and oft essay'd to catch the strain,
And treasuring‚ as on her ear they fell,
The numbers, echo'd note for note again.

The peevish youth, who ne’er had found before
Α rival of his skill, indignant heard,

And soon (for various was his tuneful stote)
ln lostier tones defied the simple bird.

She dated the task‚ and, rising as he rose,
With all the force that passion gives inspired,
Return’d the sounds awhile, but in the·close
Exhausted fell, and nt his feet expired.

Thus strength and skill prevail'd. Ο fatal striis!
By thee, poor songstreSS‚ playiuily begun3
And, Ο sad victory! which eost thy life,
And he may wish that he had never won!
