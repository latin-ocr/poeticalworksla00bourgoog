cultivated the Latin muse: nor need we sear for
him a comparison with Scotland's celebrated
Buchanan. But a far higher glory than that of
genius must be awarded to him: to a writer so
freely giving the rein to his humour, it is no
small praise to be able to assert, that he left

No line when dying he could wish to blot.

We have only to add, that in addition to his
poetical effusione, the present volume contains
two letters of Vincent Bourne; the one to a
young lady, and the other—which we have already

as the most complete and accessible form of our
author’s productione.
