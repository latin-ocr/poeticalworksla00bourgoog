RECIPROCAL KINDNESS THE Phthour
LAW OF NATURE.

rutnsot'ruo ΒΥ W. GOWPffli, HQ·

Autonoeius, from his injured lord, in dread

of instant death, to Lybio’s desert fled;

Tired with his toilsome flight. oud puroh'd without

He spied et length a coverne cool retreot;

But scoroe had given to rest his weory frome,

When, hugest oi his kind, olion came:

He roar'd approaohingz hut the savoge din

Το plaintive murmuro changed-arrived within,

And with expressive looks, his lifted pow

Presenting, oid implored from whom he saw.

The fugitive, through terror ot o stand,

Dared not ewhile offord his trembliug hands

But holder grown, ot length inherent found

A pointed thorn, ond drew it from the wouud.

The oure was wrought ;-hewiped thesoniouo blood,

And firm ond free from pain the lion stood.

Aguiu he seeks the wilds, oud day hy day

Regoles his inmete with the ported prey.

Nor he disdains the dole, though unprepered,

Spreod on the ground, oud with o lion shored.
But th us to live-still iostqeeoueoter'hot'hh-
Scoroe soem'd his lord's reoeuge mmmm·
