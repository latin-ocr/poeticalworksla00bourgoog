From the vain bride, (ah 1 bride no more Ι)
The varying orimson fled;

When, stretoh’d before her rival's corse,
She saw her husband dead.

He to his Luoy’s new·made grave,
Convey'd by trembling sueino,

One mould with her, beneath one sod,
For ever now remains.

Ost at this grave, the constant hind
And plighted maid are seem

With garlands gay, and true-love knots
They deck the sacred green.

But, swain foresworn, whoe'er thou art,
This hallow'd spot sorbeam

Remember Colin’s dreadful fate,
And sear to meet him there.

ADVICE TO CHLOE.

Dana Chloe, while thus beyond measure,
You treet me with doubts and disdain,

You rob all your youth of its pleasure,
And hoard up an old ageos pain.
Your maxim, that love is still founded
On charms that will quiokly deoay,

You'H find to be very 'rh grounded,
When once you its drotates ohey.
