¹¹2 neusse.

She likes not witin lewdness shown,
J ests ill-manner'd for a clown;

But hears, with ignoranee or rege,
Double meanings of the stage.

Her spotless mind, the lustful tale
Nauseates in the nicest veil.

She ne’er is found in crowds unchen,
Entred mysteries 0bscene;

Nor seeks in mask, and antis dress,
Unconfined lasciviousness:

Nor pale, and angry, gaming high,
Rattles the unluchy die.

Till sunrise restless vigils keeps,
Light consuming in her sleeps;

lnverling nature, turns with play
Day lo night, and night to day.

This round of lollies let her choose,
Flitling life who likes to lose,

And leti her quiclly-ending days
Pass, and perish es they pass.

The time that vulger maids despise‚
Careless, thoughtless‚ how it llies,

Melissa wise, esteems‚ and knows
Well to use it, ere it goes.

If e’er Melissa wed my friend,
With her ent’ring shall attend

Virtues and greces by her side,
Bridemaids fit lot sueh shhhe:

Neat beauty without ath hishley'h.
Rosy health with nasise tem
