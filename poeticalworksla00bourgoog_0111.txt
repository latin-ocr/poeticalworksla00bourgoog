Lova msnshsn.

Though simple in its dress and plain,
lt ushers in e beauteons train;

And elaims‚ how gaudy e‘er they be,
The meritos precedeney.

All that the gay or sweet compose,
The pink, the violet, and the rose,
ln fair succession as they blow,

Their glories to the snowdrop owe.

LOVE DISARMED.

ΒΥ PRIOR·

Bannavu a myrtle‘s verdant shade,
As Chloe hals esleep was laid,
Cupid pereh‘d lightly on her bremt,
And in that heaven desired to rest:
Over her paps his wings he spread,
Between he found a dovvny bed,
And nestled in his little head.

Still lay the god: the nymph surprised
Yet mistress of herself, devised
How she the vagiant might enthral,
hnd captive him, who captives all.
ller boddiee half-wey she unlace'd:
About his arms she slilv east
l 'I'he silken bend, antl hein him last.
