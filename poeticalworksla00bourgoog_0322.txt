Hrc infra jacet,
Ε silentio et tenebris
ln lueis et gloriaetransierenda aeternitatem,
Egregii nominis mulier
F. T.

Terris ideirco data et adempta,
Ut intelligerent homines
Quo virtus amore
Amplectenda sit incolumis,
Qua invidia
Quaerenda sit sublata.

IN BARBADOS.

Saored to the memory

of Anne, the beloved wife
oi Mn. Doonnr Woonnnroon,

In the remembrance of whate'er was dear
Deserves the pious tribute oi a tear,

Bestow it on the dust that sleepeth near:
That precious dunt, which living did comprise
The fair, the good, the graeefnl, and the wise.
Bestow a tear; nor think thy sorrow lost,
Another, and another, should it eost:

The real worth of virtue ne'er is known,

Till ravish’d from before our eyes, and gone.

She died
October 5, ornemur„
Ageh xxxii.
