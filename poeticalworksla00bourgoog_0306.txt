Tusa plaguy Percy almost broke my back ;

Nay and my wind too ;-boy, aoup 01 sack. ,
'l'here’s not a man cares less than Ifor death,
But plaguy fighting puts one out of breath:

Yet if bright honour calls me to a fray,

1 shall be very bold—to-run away.

Well; when the king makes plump sir John a lord,
Then I’m resolv’d-never to keep my word.
First I'll begin with hostess Quickly: much

She 'gins to talk 01 ladyship and conch ;

A body cannot owe 'm a little money,

But strait the jadas must think 01 matrimony.
But yet a triok worth two 01 that I’ll play her;
Poor 10011 001 10νο 001 money will l pay 1101.

11 10 the street a civil dun should oome;

Pray 0010010-10011011, and-I'll be 11010 horne.
1110 1110111111 a number should appear,

Mylord 's asleep, sir, in his elbow cheir.

When tradesmen grow impatient for their due,
'Tls so long standing-never talk of 't-'pshewl
l've good prelerment in my eye for you.

For sempstress Doll, How (1011111110011001 somnes&
