chre too may he painted without, hut within is sull of
filthiness and uneleanness; and the corpse may be

and helying it with praises: the passenger must be
stayed, to lament its loss; and thereader is called upon
to weep, that a person illustriously descended should
be so lilre the 'rest of his sellow-ereatures-as to die.

children shall hold up their hanhs paruissemus
