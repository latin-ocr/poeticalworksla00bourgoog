wlimnlr ΑΝΙ) MARGARET.

Her bloom was like the springing flowe
Thai sips the silver dew5

The rose was budded in her oheek,
And opening to the view,

But love had, like the oanker-worm,
Consum’d herrearly prime :

The rose grew pale, and lest her oheek
She died before her time.

Anake, she oried, thy true love calls,
Come from her midnight grave;
Now let thy pity hear the maid,
Thy love refus‘d to save.

This is the dark and learlul hour.
When injur'd ghosts complain;

Now dreary graves give up their dead,
To haunt the faithless swain.

Bethink thee, william, of thy fault,
Thy pledge, and broken oath;
And give me back my moiden vow,

And give me back my troth.

How could you say my loce was fair,
And yet that sace forsoke?

How could you win my virgin heeft,
Yet leave that heort to break?
