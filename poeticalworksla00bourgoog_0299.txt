EPILOGUE TO ANDRIA,

ΒΥ emo.

Roorr here-for 1 em come to vent my joy;

Ι Son Pamphilus has got a chopping boy.

Much preparation there has been, 1 see.

Against this time. though all unknown to me.

Here stood a tankard worthy os its wine,

There did a credle in rich damesk shine‚

Caps, clouts, and sweddling clothes hung dangling ou

the line =
For sons get children at their fathers’ eost,
All things are trim, but we must pay the roast.
But yet here may remain a dismal scene,
ΑΙΙ are perplexi ’twixt joy and sear within:
Mysis, poor tim'rous souli forgets to prattle;
And, what’s more strange, the toping nurse her boteler
Crito, poor mani longs to be jogging home,
But dares not stir before he knows his doom.
To keep us all in temper then, 1 pray‚
Smile on the entertainment of this pley;
Dismiss us kindly to our sugar’d sack,
And make it not indeed a groaning cake:
So shaii we wish each sex rnen erer hnh.
Their hearers candid, m Skkssiikffiffl*
