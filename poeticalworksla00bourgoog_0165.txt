At iirst he aims at what he hears ;

And. list’rring close with both bis ears,
Just catches at the sound;

But soon articulates aloud.

Much to th' amusement os the crowd,
And stuns the neighbours round.

A querulous old woman's voice

His humorous talant next employs;
He scolda and gives the lie.

And now he sings, and now is siclr,

Here, sailly, susan, come, come quick,

Poor Poll is like to die l

Belinda and her bird! ’tis rare

'l'o meet with such a well-match'd pain
The language and the tone,

Each character in every part

Sustain’d with so much grace and art,
And both in unison.

When children first begin to spoli,
And stammer out a syllable, ο ¹

We think them tedicus creatorem
But difficulties soon abate,

When birds are to be taughtto nate„
And women are the teachers.
