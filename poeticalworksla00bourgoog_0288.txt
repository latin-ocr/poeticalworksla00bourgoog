FAMILIARITY DANGEROUS.

mmmm n! wanuh ΟΟῊΒΒ, 880· ,

As in her ancient mistress’ lap
The youthful tabby lay,

They gave each other many a tap,
Alihe disposed to play.

But strife ensues. Puss waxes warm,

And with protruded claws
Ploughs all the length of Lydia's arm,
Mete wantonness the cause.

At once, resentful of the deed,

She shakes her to the ground
With many a threat, that she shall bleed
With still a deeper wound.

But, Lydia, bid thy fury rest;
lt was a venial stroke:
For she that will with hittens ieet,

Should beat ahttehsxoke. Q
