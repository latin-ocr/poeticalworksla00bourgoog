SPARROWS SELF-DOMESTICATED

IN TRINITY contrait, caueamus.

Nora ever ahared the sociat feast,

Or as an inmate or a guest,

Beneath the celebrated dome,

Where once Sir Isaac had his home,
Who saw not (and with some delight
Perhaps he view'd the novel sight)

How numerous, at the tables there,

The sparrows beg their daily fare.

For there, in every nooh and cell,

Where such a family may dwell,

Sure as the vernal season comes

Their nests they weave in hope of crumbs,
Which hindly given, may serve with sood
convenient their unseather¹d brood;

And oft aa with its summons clear

The warning bell salutes their ear,
Sagaeious listeners to the sound‚

They θοοὶ from all the fields around, .
To reaeh the hospitable hall,

None more attentive to the call.
Arrired, the pensionary barth,
Hoppr‘rrg and chhping, close at hauh,
