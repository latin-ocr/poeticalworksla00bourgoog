THE TEARS OF A PAINTER.

Arruns, hearing that his boy

Had just expired-his only joy i

Although the sight with anguish tore him, ⁸

Bade place his deor remains before him.
He seized his brush‚-his colours spread ε
And-‘⁶ Ohi my child, aceept‚”-he said,
“ (wis ali that 1 can now bestow,)
“This tribute of a father’s woe!’'

Theo, faithful to the twoiold part,

Both of his feelings and his art,

He closed his eyes with tender care,
And form’d at once a sellow-pair.

His brow with amber looks beser,

And lips, he drew,-not livid yetr

And shoded that which he had done

To a just image of his son.

Thus far is wells. But view again

The cause of thy paternal pain i

Thy melancholy task fulfili

1t needs the last, last touches still.

Again his pencil’s powers he tries,

For on his h'ps a smile he spiss,
And stili his cheek unfoded shows
