SWEET WILLIAM'S FAREWELL ΤΟ

BLACK-EYED SUSAN.

ΒΥ ohl.

Αιι in the Downs the fleet was moor’d‚
The streamers waving in the wind,
When black·eyed Susan came on heard,-
“ Ohl where shall l my true love find?
Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
Does my sweel William sail among the crew ?''

William, who high upon the yard,
Rock'd with the billows to andsto,
Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
He slgh’d‚ and cast his eyes heloW.
The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hand!
And (quick as lightning) on the deck he stands.

So the sweet larh, high pois'd in air,
Shuts close his pinions to his breast,
ll chance his mate's shrill note he hear,
And drops at once into her nest.
The noblesl captain ‘m the thsh heel,
M1213ht en vy William's lips lhose limes mex.
