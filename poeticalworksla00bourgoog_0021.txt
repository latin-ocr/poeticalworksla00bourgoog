SONG OF THE THREE CHILDRE

an'nn God’s fiat did from nothing mise,

Stupendous product of the first six days,

Obless your Maker, your Creator praise.
In this let jarring elements agree,

Or make from discord sweetest harmony.

Ye sons of light made by his power divine ;
By his reflected beams it is you shine;
Your hallelnjahs in the chorus join‚

Thu, far as ereatures can, your praise may

Greut as his power, and endless as his love.
