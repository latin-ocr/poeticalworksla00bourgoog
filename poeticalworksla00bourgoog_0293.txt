EPILOGUE ΤΟ THE ADELPHL

SPOKEN ΒΥ caumana,

ENGLISHED.

Poon nurse is sent to bid you all good b’ye,
A plain, but neat and night old woman 1,
(Except what should excepted be, you know) ’
Α very moer old trot from top to toe.
But come, dear Faustum try enohnntments here,
And make e¹eu me a blooming maid appear ς
To loolr with beauty, and to move with ease,
And nicely taught a thousand ways to plenae.
[ste waves a nond
Speak‚ do long lappeta wauton ware in air,
Does the struit oawl presa down my auburn hair?
Are patches rang'd of large and smaller aize?
Bere to my snowy ohest, say, does my bosom riae?
My spreading hoop raiae st'rff ita ampler sphere,
A sevensold arch, an amphitheatre?
Ahl conjurer Faustus, vain thy wand and skilt

Nor are old women witches when they will.

[She breaks the wand.
Old as Ι was, 1 am ; whate’er they say,
Grey were my looks before, and still are grey.

No strutting hoop my oangt'rny, oxomeaneara oxu„
nen was, and red remorae, my oettrooat.
