ΟΝ THE ASCENSION.

Yn numerous hosts oi ungels'bright‚
Your winged multitudes prepare,
ln ull your grandeur to attend
The king oi glory thro' the uir.

0 maie your sweetest harmony,

⁴ As he triumphant takes his ugho

Towering on high above the sun,
Thro’ renlms immense of spacious ligh

ln ohoicest hymns, melodious throng
Salute tho conqueror, your king;
ln joyiultlays ond loudest siunins,
Ye blest, your God returning sing.

And now, in majesty divine,

He sito enrob'd by ’s Father's side ;
But still vouohsafes to intercede

For sinful mun, ior whom he died.

Thon, man, thy deor Redeemer bless.
With thanksul beart, as they ubove;
With them begin u song of praise,
A song us endless us his love.
