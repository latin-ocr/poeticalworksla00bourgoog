At down poor Stella donc¹d and sung,
The am'rous youth around her bow'd;
At night her fatal lmell wos rung,
1 ειν, and kiss'd her in her shroud.

Such as she is, who died to-day‚
Such Ι, alosl may be to-morrow;

Go, Damon, hid thy muse display
The justice ol thy Chloe’s sorrow.

THE WREATH.

Swrrr, lovely, charte,
Ye lilies, hoste,
That in the vallies breathe:
To Phyllis haste,
Sweet, lovely, ohoete,
For Phyllis twine the wreath.

Ye roseo, come,
With virgin bloom,

The pride of gardens own'd3
That from your bed

Diffusive shetl
Ambrosial odours routh.
