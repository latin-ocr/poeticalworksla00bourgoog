AN ENIGMA.

retritum ΒΥ W. cowelle, ESQ· ¹

Α rernm small, as small can be,

In bulk and use, surpasses me,
Nor is my purchase dean

For little and almost sor nought‚

As many ol my kind are bought

As days are in the year.

Yet though but little use we boast,

And are procured at little eost,
The lahour is not light;

Nor lew artificers it aska,

All skillul in their several their,
To lashion us aright.

One fures metal 0'er the lire,
Δ second draws it into wire,
The shears another plies;
Who clips in lengths the brazen thread
For him, who, ehafing every ehieh,
Girer all en equal size.
