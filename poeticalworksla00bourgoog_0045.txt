AN ODE.

V.
'l'hen see the sorrows os my beart,
Ere yet it be too late,
Andhear my Saviour’s dying gruans,
To give those sorrows weight.
v1.
For never shall my soul despair
Her pardon to procure,

Who knows thy only Son has died.
To make that pardon sure.

THE mmmmm OF mm xlx.

1.
Tun spacious firmament on high, ·
With all the blue ethereal sky,

The spangled heav’m, a shining franse,
Their great original proclairn.

The unwearied sun, from day to day.
Does his Creator's pow'r display;

And publishes to ev'ry land

The work of an almighty hand.
