ΟΝ ALL SAINTS‘ DAY.

{ara ye, whose sacred multitudes
ln numbers cannot he exprest;
rau ye, that fill with winged erowds
The joyful regions of the blest;
[⁸0 you our humble verse we hring;
ris you instruct us how to sing.

(e blest attendants of your lord,
While he rouchsat'd on earth to preach,
ty him as Messangers the word
Throughout the world sent forth to teaoh r
l'was you the happy tidings brought,
Tourselves performing what you taught.

'e prophets, who with ardent real
And knowledge heavenly possest,
'o future ages did reveal
The secretu of Jehovah's breast;
swas you, enlighten’d from above,
oresaw and told that God was love.

'ou were the ohuroh’s best defense,
Ye martyre now enthron’d on high,
ravely secure in innoeence‚
And boldly resolute to die;
>anag (so firrnly ye withstood)
r spite of notice to ba good.
