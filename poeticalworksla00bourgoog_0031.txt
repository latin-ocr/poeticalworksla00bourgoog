12 THE SONG ΟΕ THE 'rum cursualis.

Ye clouds with sulphur charg'd, his proise rer

Louder then thuoder in your coverne bound;

Lightnings, thot quiohly die, ond dying wouh
Ere yet your momentary flash is done,
Praise him, whose lustre can be never gon<

Proise him, 0 earth, whilst thou thyself shalt

Thy solid orb in liquid aether placed,

'l'ho' hung on nothing, is ior ever fast:
Praise him whose being is sustairr‘d by non
Himseifis oentre of himself alone.

Ye mounts ond hius, crown'd with a pompous

of groves, where idols placed their old rhode,

Resound the proises of a real God,
Whoshow’d his goodness‚ who proolaim’d h
On Horeb’s mountain, endon Sina's hill.

Praise him, ye greens‚ by fruitful nature born

And rising orops that plenteous vales adorn

Where zephyrs rustle thro’ the wavy eorm
Who clothes in greater state each springirrg
Thon that which drew from sartho southern

Ye wells and streams. your source of moisture

Who made, when urged oi old his pow‘r to sh

Forth from rh‘ obedient roclr the waters flow.
Notis the iountoin of his praises dry,

But urrethied stores sor ever wiii suyoh
