THE CRICKET.

Thus thy preise shall be express’d,
inoffensive, weloome guest l
While the ret is on the eeout,

And the mouse with eurious snout,
With what vermin else intest
Ev'ry dish, end spoil the besu
Frisking thus before the fire,

Thou host all thine heert's desire.

Though in voice and shepe they be
Form’d ee if ahin to thee,

Thou surpassest, happier fer,
Happiest gresshoppers thet are;
Theirs is hut a summer's song,
Thine endures the winter long,
Unimpair'd, and shrill, andeleio,
Melody throughout the year.

Neither night nor dawn oi day,

Puts a period to thy play:

Sing, then-and expend thy spen

Fer beyond the dete of man.
Wretched man, whose years ere spent
In repining discontent,

Lines not, aged though he he,
Half a span, compared with thee.
