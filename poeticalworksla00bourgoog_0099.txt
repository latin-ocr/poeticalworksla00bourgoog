⁵⁴ Ah, Colin! give not her thy vova,
Vows due to me alone;

Nor thou, fond maid, receive his hiss,
Nor think him all thy own.

To-morrow in the church to wed,
Impatient, both prepare;

But know, fond maid; and know false man,
That Lucy will be there.

“ There beer my eorse, ye comradeS, beer,
The bridegroom blithe to meet;

He in his wedding trim so gay,
Ι in my winding-sheet.”

She spoke, she died ;-her corse was borne.
The bridegroom blithe to meet;

He in his wedding trim so gay,
She in her winding-sheet.

Then what were perjur'd Colin’s thoughts?
How were those nuptials kept?

The bridemen floek’d round Lucy dead,
And all the village wept.

Compassion‚ shame, remorso, despair,
At once his bosom swell;

The damps of death hedew'dhiehrows‚

x He Sh00k‚ he groon'd, he ioh.
