THE· FANATIC.

tto speak uprises Simon Pure,
tandS. with coun‘tenance demure;
‚ he spits, with many a hawk and hem,
way sor words, and utter them:
beside him on the pulpit lle,

oad hands to heav’n are lifted high ;

ds shut he groans sor, closely pent,
'ring spirit struggles sor a vent;

a voice breaks out beneath his hat,

nd another after that:

d sofr, with frequent pauses mixt.

a sigh, and many a groan betwixt;
3rees he sans, with zealot ire,

nrt coals of Puritanic fire.

starts, he bounds, on tiptoe stands,

his voice, and hammers with his hands;
:th of lungs he tries, he pants he blows,
his cheeks the sweat profusely flows:
>ul he threatens instant doom,

ric tempest shakes the room.

ς Boreas first, with lenient breeze,

ght leaves, and murmurs thro· the trees,
inflated soon a tempest bron.

rull tops above, their trnnks henan ·.
