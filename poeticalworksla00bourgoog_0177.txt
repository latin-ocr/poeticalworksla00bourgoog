THE CANTAB.

TRANSLA'I'ED ΒΥ W. 00WER, ESQ.

Wrrrr two sputo, or one—and no great matter which-
Boots bought, or boots borrow'd, a whip or o switel,
Five slrillingS‚ or less, for the hire of his beust,
Pald part into hand 2-you must walt sor the rest
Thus equlpt‚ Academicus climbs up his horse,
And out they both sally, lor better or worse;
His heart void of sear, and as light es a feather.
And in violent haste to go not knowing whither.
Through the fields and the towns (see 1) he soom·
pers along,
And is look'd at and laugh'd by old and by younssv
Till at length overspent‚ and his sides smear’d vill
blood,
Dovvn tumbles his horse, man and all in the mod
ln awaggon‚ or chatse, shall he finish hie route?
Oh l seandalous iatel he must do it on loot.
Young gentlemen, hear l -l am older than you.
The advice that l give l have proved to be true:
Wherever your journey may be, never doubt it.
The foster you ride, vodio tlxelovlger about it.
