The love, that from beauty is drawn,
By kindness you ought to improvez
Soft looks and gay smiles are the down,
Fruition's the sunshiue of love:
And though the bright beams of your eyes
Should be clouded, that now are so goy,
And darkness possess all the skies,
We ne'er con forget it was day.

Old Darby. with J oon by his side,
You’ve osten regarded with wonder ;
He’s dropsicah she is sore-eyed,
Yet they're ever uueasy asunder.
Together they totter about,
Or sit in the sun at the door ;
And at night, when old Darby's pot’s out,
His J oen will not smoke a whiff more.

No beauty norwit they possess,
Their several failings to smother;
Then what arethe oharms, cau you guess.
That make them so fond oi euch other?
'Tis the pleasing remembrance of youth,
The eudearmeuts which youth did bestow;

The thoughts of past yieusuie ouh tuith,
The best of our hiessiugshehow.
