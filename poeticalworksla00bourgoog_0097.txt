Lucu ΛΝΒ coum.

Oh, hove you seen a lily pale,
When bearing ruins descend?

So droop'd the slow-oonsuming maid,
Her life now neor its end.

By Lucy warn'd‚ of flattering ewrino
Take heed, ye easy fair:

of vengeance due to broken vous,
Ye perjur’d swains, bewore.

Three times, all in the deod of night,

A bell was heard to ring ;

And shrieking at her window thrice,
The raven flapp'd his wing.

Too well the love-lorn maiden knew
The solemn boding sound,

And thus, in dying words hespoke
The virgins weeping round:

‘⁸ 1 heora voice you cannot hear,
Which says. 1 must not stay3

Ι see e hand you cannot see,
Which beckons me away,

By a false heart, and broken vous,
111 early youth I die:

Am lto blame, because his hride

Is thrice as rich es ii
