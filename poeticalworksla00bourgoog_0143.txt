THE calcum.

Ost was seen, in ages past,
All that we with wonder viem

Often shall be to the last;
Earth produces nothing ηοω.

Thee we gratulate, content,
Should propitious Heaven design

Life for us as calmly spent,
Though but half the length of thine.

THE CRICKET.

Tnnnsnmn ΒΥ W. ΟΟῩΙΡΕΒ, BSQ·

an inmate, full os mirth.
Chirping on my kitchen hearth,
Wheresoe’er be thine abode‚
Always harbinger of good,

Pay me for thy warm retreat

With a song more sost and sweet;
In return thou shalt xecdwe

Such a strain as 1 can g'we.
