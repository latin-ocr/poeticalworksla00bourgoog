The epilogue puts me in a great quendary:
iffudique sales, mea lex eonsumitur et toutet
ty wit is at an end, my law is out.
teseio quid dieo, aut dico quod non ego nosco ;
know not what to say, or say not what I know.
why truly-may it please you-I demum
hemoria sine brief is never sure.

We, as we humbly do conceive, may move
i'hese honourable benches, as above,
i'hat we may now be elients unto you;
Tis not ‘in forma pauperis' we sue:
ind as we in your judgment stand, that we
tiay likewise iu your honours¹ favour be.
Phis being granted, may be, gentlemen,
We'll humbly move this court to sit again,
hster due notice hon, and where, and when.
ind so ye stand adjourned.
