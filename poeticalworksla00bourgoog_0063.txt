WlLLlAM AND MARGARET.

Then to her new love let her go,

And deck her in golden array; ¹
Be finest at ev’ry fine show, ³

And froliek it all the long day:
While Colin, sorgotten and gone,

No more shall be talk’d of, or seen,x
Unless when beneath the pale moon

His ghost shall glide over the green.

WlLLlAM AND MARGARET,

ΒΥ mvn> nnnnss'r.

Wrrrrn all was wrapt in dark midnlght‚
And all were fast asleep‚

In glided Margaret’s grimly ghost,
And stood at Willlam's feet.

Her face was like the April morn,

clad in a wintry cloud;
And clay-eold was her lily-hand,
That held the sable shroud.

So shall the fairest face appear,
When youth and years are flown;
Srrclr r's¹ the robe that klngs must wear,
eren death has rell tlre'n ernnn.
