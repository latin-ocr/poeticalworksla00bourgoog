8 ono soso oo ouo mm emonam.

Who with majestio pomp, and terror join'd‚
Rides charioting on clouds, and walls on wing

wind.

Ye flames, exalt the universal ohoir;

On zeal, brlght as yourselves, to God aspire;

God, a consuming‚ and a harmless dre:
Whooe falling lires Elijoh's foeo could tome,
Who shone in Moses' bush a lambent dame.

Ye winter’s chilloess, ond ye summer’s sun,
Thot round the year in stated periods run,
Praise him in your eternal antiphon,

Who, when the fatal flood ol old was pasl,

Promis’d the seosons with the world should las

Ye honey-dews of Moy, like vopours riso,

Exhaled in praises to your native skies;

And hoory dost, which o’er the meadow lies
