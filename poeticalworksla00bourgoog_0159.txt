The metron herself, ln whose old ege we ε
Not a trees of decline-what s wonder is ι

With looks like the ribbon with which they
While glossy end smooth, und ss sonas t'
Of a delicate peselo, lethe down of her ol
But nothing unplesssnt or ssd, or sever
Or thet indicates life ln lts winter-is he
Yet sll is express’d with fidelity due,
Nor s pimple or lreokle oonoeel’d from
Many fond ol new sights, or who oh

For labours ol srt, to the spectacla hu
The youths sll agree, thet, would old

Ridloulous nothing or hideous in th
The nymphe lor themselves sunuel·
