caton HUN‘I'ING·

The chain l’ll in return untie;

And sreely thou again shalt fly.¹'
Thus she the captive did deliver3
The captive thus gave up his quiver.

The god disarm'd, e’er since that day,
Passes his life in harmleas play;
Flies round, or sits upon her breast,
A little, fiutt'ring‚ idle guest.

E'er since that day, the beauteous mai
Governs the world in Cupid's stead,
Directs his arrows as she wills;

Gives grief or pleasure‚ sparea or kills.

CHLOE HUNTING.

ΒΥ Paion.

Banrnn her neck her comely tresses tied,
Her iv'ry quiver gracesul by her side,

A hunting Chloe went: she lost her way,
And through the woods uncertain chanc’d =
Apollo passing by beheld the maid;

And, Sister decr, bright Cynthia, turn, he
The hunted hind lies close in yonder brak·
Loud Cupid laugh’d, to see the god's mis ι
And laughing cried, Learn better, great ‹l‘

To Irnon thy lindred‚ and to honour rn'r
