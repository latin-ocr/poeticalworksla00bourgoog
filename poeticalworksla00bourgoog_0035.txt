HYMN THE FIRST.

r.
Wurm all thy meroies, Ο my God‚
My rising soul surveys
Transported with the view l'm lost
ln wonder, love, and proise.
11.
Ohow shall words with equnl wormth‚
The gratitude declam,
Thnt glows within my ravish'd breastl
But thou oanst read it there.
111.
Thy providenee my lise sustnin'd,
And all my wonts remeet,
When in the silent womb llay,
And hung upon the breast.
rv.
To all my weak complaints and ories
Thy mercy lent an ear,
Ere yet my feeble thoughts had learnt
To sorm themselves in pray'r.
V·
Unrrumber'd comforts to my soul
Thy tender care bestow'd,
Before my infant heart oonoeiv'd
From whom those cornsorts flow'd.
