The flow'rs she wor'e along the day ;
And ev’ry nymph and shepherd said,

That in her hair they look'd more gay
Than giowing in their native bed.

Undrest at evening, when she found
Their colours lost, their odours past,
She chang'd her look, and on the ground

Her garland and her eye she cast.

That eye dropt sense distinet and clear,
As any inuse‘s tongue could speak;
When from its lid apearly tear
Ran trickling down her beauteous eheek.

Dissembling what l knew too well,
“ My love, my lise‚” said 1, “ explain,
This change of humanu pr’ythee tell,
That falling tear, what does it mean?

She sigh'd3 she smiled; and to the fiowera
Pointing‚ the lovely moralist said,

See, friend, in some few fleeting honre,
See yonder‚ what a change is madei

Ah mei the'hlooming pride os May
And that of beauty are hut one:

At naon both flourish htighi anh gay ¹.

Both fade at evening, nahe anh anne·
