THE SILK-WORM.

Twhwshhrho ΒΥ W. cowrssn, 880·

Tris beams os April, ere it goes,
A worm, soarce visible, disclose;
All winter long content to dwell
The tenant of his native shell.
The same prolific seoson gives
The sustenance by which he lives,
The mulberryleaf, a simple stote,
Thai serves him-till he nee'ds no morel
For, his dimensions once complete,
Thenceiorth none ever sees him eat;
Though‚ till his growing time be past,
Searce ever is he seen to last.
That hour arrived, his work begins;
He spins and weaves, and weaves and spins;
Till circle upon circle wound
Careless around him and around‚
Conoeals him with rivell, though slight,
impervious to the keenest sight.
Thus serf-enclosed, as in e oash,
At length he finishes his lasis:
