186 Α nnrunc,

The whitest hands that secret honrd
oft visit: and the sair

Preserve it in their bosom stored.
As with c miser's care.

Thence implements of every size,
And lcrm’d lor various use,

(They need but tc consult their eyes‚)
They readily produce.

The largest and the longest kind

Possess the foremost page,
A sort most needed by the blind,
Or nearly such from age.

The full charged lens, which next ensuee,
Presents in bright erray
The smeller sort, which matrone use,

Not quite so blind as they.

The third, the forth, the fllth supply
What their occasions ask,

Who with a more discerning eye
Perlorm e nicer tnsk.

But still with regular decreese
From sire to size they fall.

ln every leel grew lese anhleeet
The laet ere lecet ci nli.
