AN ODE.

ιι.
Soon es the evening shedes premii,
The moon takes up the wond'roue tale,

And nightly‚ to the listening earth,

Repente the story of her birth:

Whilst cll the sters that round her burn,

And all the planete in their turn,

Confirm the tidings, as they roll,

And spread the truth from pole to pole.
111.

What though, in solemn silence, all

Move round this derk terrestrial hall?

What though nor recl voice nor sound

Amidst their redient orbs be found?

In reason’s ear they eil rejoice,

And utter forth a glorious voice,

For ever singing as they shine‚

‘⁶ The hand that made us is divine.”
