Feou right to lest, and to and fro,
Caught in a labyrinth‚ you go,

And turn, and turn, and turn again,

To solve the mystea, but in vain ;
Stand still and breathe, and take from me
A eleva, that soon shall set you free l
Not Ariadne, if you meet her,

Herself could serve you with a better.
You enter’d easily-..find where-

And make, with ease, your exit there 1

melosa senem, succincta, et sedula (fingit

Sic tabula Heemskirkff ludicra) tondet anus.
nque vices (idem sic ludit amabile pictor)

AEqua tondet enum conditione senex.

Fas est, alterius poseat ut &Rex om·
