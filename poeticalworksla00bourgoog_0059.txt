COLIN’S COMPLAINT.

ΒΥ nlcnonns ROWE·

Deorumno beside o clear stream,
A shepherd forsaken was laid3
And while a false nymph was his theme·
A willon supported his head.
The winde, that blew over the plain,
To his sighs with a sigh did reply;
And the brooh‚ in return to his pain,
Ren mournfully murmuring by.

Alasl silly swain thet l wasl
Thus sodly complaining, he eried;
When first 1 beheld thet sair face,
’Twere better by sar 1 hed died:
She tanco, and Ι bleso the dent tongue5
When she smil’d, ’twas a pleasure too gn
Ilisten’d‚ end ery'd‚ when she sung,
Was nightingale ever so sweetl

How foohsh was lto believe,

She could dont on so lowly a olown !
Or, thot her fond heert would not grieve‚
To forsahe the fine solk os the town !

To think that a beauty so goy.
So kind ond so constant wonhh otone.

Or go elad like our maidene'm grew.
