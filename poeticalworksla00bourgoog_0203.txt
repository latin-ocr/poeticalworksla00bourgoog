There is a book, which we may call
(Its excellence is such)

Alone a librory, though small ς
The hdies thumb it much.

Words none, things numerous it contains:
And things with words compared,

Who needs be told, that has his hrains,
Which merit most regards?

Ofttimes its leaves of seerlet hue
A golden edging boest;

And open'd, it displeys to view
Twelve peges al the most.

Nor neme, nor title, stamp'd behind,
Adorns its outer pern
But all within 'tis tichlv ΚΜ,

A megszine oi sic.
