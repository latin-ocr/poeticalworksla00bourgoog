Death’s delicious banquet-we
Perish even from the womb,

Swifter than a shadow fiee,
Nourish'd but to seed the tomb.

Seeds of merciless disease
Lurk in all that we enjoy;
Some that waste us by degrees,
Some that suddenly destroy.

And is life o’erleap the bourn
Common to the sons of men,

What remim, but that we mourn,
Dream‚ and dote, and drivel then.

Fast as moon can wax and wane,
Sorrow comem and, while we grona,
Pant with anguish‚ and complain,
Half our years are fied and gone. .

If a few (to few ’tis given),
Lingering on this earthly stage.

Creep and halt with steps uneven
To the period of an age,

Wherefore live they, but to see
cunning, arrogance, and force,

Sights lamented munh hy me,
Holding their accustom'ss comm?
