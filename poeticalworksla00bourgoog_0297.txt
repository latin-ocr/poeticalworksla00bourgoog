PROLOGUE TO renotanda,

ΒΥ ANTONIUS.

Onon in an age let Ignoramus come

'l'o make a visit near his proper home;
Long is it since at Cambridge he appear’d,
And from that time (l spealr with due regard)
He has not oft at westminster been heard.
If any such there be among the gown,

He’s some recorder of a factious town,

Or petty manager against the crown.

An Ignoramus amongst all the swarm‚

Can not be seen here ev'ry day in term;
None to the bar or to the bench pretends,

But he that laws with eloquence defends.

Against the gown no evil we intend,

On them our glebe and future tithes depend;
All we propose is to give some delight,

Α Α scholar-like diversion for a night

For at the ancient seat os learning, where

This play first enter'd on a theatre,

The gravest students deign'd to have ashare.

And twice, if Cambridge poets rightly sing,

Did Ignoramus entertain a ling.

The character his pleasant humour hit ;

The king with gracions mirth had like to split-
There was another rhyme, but not so fit.

Our hope is then, though hlach shonhdhe oar haam

If less diverted, yon'll go sweeterhome.
