THE INVITATION TO THE RED-BREAST.

Swm bird, whom the winter constrains-
And seldom another it can-
To seek a retreat while he reigns
In the well-shelter’d dwelling of man,
Who never can seem to intrude,
Though in all places equally free,
Come, ost as the season is rude,
Thou art sure to be welcome to me.

At sIght os phe first seeble ray
That pierces the clouds os the east,
To inveigle thee every day,
My windows shall show thee a feast.
For, taught by experience‚ Ι know
Thee mindsul of benefit long;
And that, thanksul sor all 1 bestow,
Thou wilt pay me with many a song.

Then‚ soon es the swell os the buds
Bespeaks the renewel os spring,
ΡΙ] hence, if thou w'sst, te me voees,
Go where it shall phase mee m e'mga
