THE &ow-mm?

And shouldst thou, compell'd hy a frost,
Come again to my window or door,
Doubt not an affectionate host,
Only pay as thou paidst me before.

This music must needs be consess’d
To flow from asountain above ς
Else how should it work in the breast
Unchangeable friendship and love?
And who on the globe can be found,
Save your generation and oum,
That can be delighted hy sound,
Or boasts any musical pow’rs?

THE SNOWDROP.

Wwfl head reclin’d, the snowdrop seel
The first os Flora’s progeny,

ln virgin modesty appear,

To hail and welcome in the year!

Fearless os winter, it defles

The rigour of inclement skies‚

And early hastens forth to m'mg
The tidings of approaffimg swx'mg.
