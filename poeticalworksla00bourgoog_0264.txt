THE INNOCENT THIEF.

rumetum> ΒΥ wlhuhu COWPER, ESQ·

Noe eflower can be found in the fields,
Or the spot thet we till for our pleasure,

From the largest to least, but it yields
The bee, never-wearied, atreesure.

Scaree any she quits unexplored‚
with e diligence truly exect;

Yet, steal what she may for her hoard,
Leeves evidence none of the fact.

Her lucrative task she pursuee
And pilfers withso much address,
‘rhet none of their odour they lose,
Nor cherm by their beeuty the less.

Not thus inoffensively preys
The eueher-worm, indwelling soe!

His vomcity not thus aheys

The sperrow, the fineh‚ ot hhe emh. z
