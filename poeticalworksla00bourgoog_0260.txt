THE SNAlL.

rnsustttsn ΒΥ wrttltst COWPER, ΗΒΘ.

Το grass, or leaf, or fruit, or wall,

The Snail stichs close, nor iears to sall,

As if he grew there, house and all
Together.

Within that house secure he hides,
When danger imminent betides
Oi stom, or other harm besides

Of westher.

Give but his horns the slightest touch,

His sels-collecting power is such,

He shrinks into his house with much
Displeasure.

Where'er he dwells‚ he dwells alone,

Except himself has chattels none,
Well satisfieri to be his own

Whoie tr essere.
