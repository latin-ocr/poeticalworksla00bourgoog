Here lies
Jonn Arcana, Esq3 doctor oi physic,
One of his Majesty's Justices of the Peuce
For the County of Westmoreland3 who
Departed this life the 4th of December, nuccxxxv.
He was a worthy man, a skilful physician,
An impartial magistrate, and an amiable friend:
His mind was generous, his temper sweet,
His understanding extensive;
In nature he was compassionate,
In virtue severe.
He adorned the reasonable being
With the dignity of morality3
The true christian,
With the sanctity of religion.
He was a delight to his acquaintance,
An honour to his profession,

And an happiness to his country.

Dear and desirable is the memory of Dr. Archer,
Cruel and lamentable is the loss of him ι
Every eye overflows with tears,

Every breast is filled with sorrow,

And every house is become
The house of mourning.
