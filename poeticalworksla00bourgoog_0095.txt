How does my lore pass the long day?
Does Mary 1101 tend a few sheep?

Do they never carelessly stray,
While happily she lies asleep‘?

'l'weed’s murmurs should 11111 her to rest,
K'md nature indulging my bliss;

To relieve the sort pains of my breest,
I’d steal en ambrosial khes.

'Tis she does the virgins excel,
No beauty with her can eompare3
Love’s greces all round her 110 dwell;
She's saitem, where thousands are faire

Say. charmer, where do thy flocks stray?
Oh 1 tell me, at hoon where they seed?
Shall 1 seek them on sweet-winding Tay,
Or the pleasanter banhs of the Tweed?

LUCY AND COLIN.

Or Leinster‚ famed for maidens fair,
Bright Lucy was the grace;

Nor e’er did Liffy's hmpid stream
Refleet so fair a face, .

Til] luckless love, and pining care,
Impair'd her rosy hue,

Her coral lips, 01111 (1111111011 01100110,

And eyes 01 ghossy hhre.
