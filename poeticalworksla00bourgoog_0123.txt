THE waltun.

Ye violem, too,
In fields that grorv‚

And drink the vernal dew3
That dash the wood8‚

The meads‚ the floods.
With drops of purple hue*

And all ye flowerS.
Whose wilder stores

O’er nature's face are seen ;
Whose various dyes
Promiscuous rise‚

And paint th’ enamell'd green.

Come, herbS‚ all ye
That tempt the bee
From leaf to leaf to roam;
Whose balmy veins
Reward her pairs,
And send her loaded home.

All, all be join’d,
Of ev'ry kind,
Flowers, herbs; the sweet. the gay;
Twist arm in arm,
Weave charm wrm emm,
Το Phyllis hasmo away.
