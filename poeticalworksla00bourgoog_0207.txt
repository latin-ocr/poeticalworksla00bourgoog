Ο 1 what a fund of genius,' pent
In narrow space is here!

This volume‘s method and intent
How luminous and clear 1

lt leaves no render at a loss
Or posed, whoever reads:
No commentator's tedious gloss,
, Nor even index needs.

Search Bodley’s many thousands 0'er1
Νὸ book is treasured there,

Nor yet in Granta's numerous stote,
That may with his compare.

No l-rival none in either host
of this was ever seen,

Or, that contents could justly bouet,
So brilliant and so keen.
