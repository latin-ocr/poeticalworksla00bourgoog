THE CAUSE WON.

nunusntrnn si W. COWPER‚ ΗΒΕ.

Two neighbonrs furiously disputo,

A field the subject of the suit:

Trivial the spot, yet such the tage

With which the combatants engage‚

'Twere hard to tell who covets most

The price-ot whatsoerer cost.

The pleadings swelle words still sufficet

No single word but has its price;

No term but yields some fair pretence

For novel and increased expense.
Defendant thus becomes a name,

Which he that bore it may disclaim‚

Since both, in one description blended‚

Are plointiffs-when the suit is ended.

PLUS SClRE OPORTET, QUAM LOQUI.

Quis gravitas oculis! et quae constantia fronti i
Sobrius ut toto pectore bubo sapit!
Ales Pythagora dignus, dignusque Minerva!
Sermonis parcus, consiliique tenax!
Oh habitet tecum, bubo, et sit pectorein'rsto,
Quicquid habes: quoties cihuot, omen erit. ·
