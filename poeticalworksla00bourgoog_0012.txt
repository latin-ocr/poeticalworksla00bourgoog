PREFACE. ⁴ V

Ipassed through it He was so good natured‚
and so indolem, that I lost more than Ι got by
him: for he made me as idle as himself.”* We
will make another quotation from the same let-
ter of Cowper, which illustrates the character of
our author in far better terms than we could
pourtray it. “His humour,'’ Cowper observes,
“ is entirely original ι he can spealr of a magpie or
acat in terms so exquisitely appropriated to the
character he draws, that one would suppose him
animated by the spirit of the creature he de-
scribes. And with all this drollery there isa
mixture of rational, and even religious reflection
at times; and always an air of pleasantry, good-
nature, and humanity, that makes him, in my
mind, one of the most amiable writers in the
world. lt is not common to meet with an author
who cau make you smile, and yet at nobody’s
expense ; who is always entertaining, and always
harmless; and who, though always elegant, and
classical to adegree not always found even in the
classico themselves, charms more by the simplicity
and playt'ulness of his ideas, than by the neatness
and purity of his verse.”

With all the deterence, however, which we
may be disposed to pay to the toste of Cowper,
we must admit, that the partiality to which he
himself pleads guilty, has influenced his decision
on the merita of our author. His flow of ideas,
his beauty of diction, his propriety of sentiment,
desert him as soon as he attempta alyr'rc stratu·
