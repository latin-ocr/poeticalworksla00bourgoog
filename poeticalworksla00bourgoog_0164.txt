THE PARROT.

‘russanen ΒΥ W. coms, ESQ.

ln painted plumes superbly dress'd,
A native of the gorgeous east,
By many a billow toss'd,
Poll gains at length the British shore,
Part ol the captain's preclous store,
A present to his toast.

Belinda’s maids are soon prelerr’d‚
Το teach him now and then a word,
As Poll can master it;
But 'tis her own important charge,
'l'o quality him more at large,
And make him quite a wit.

Sweet Poll! his doting mistress eries,

Sweet Polll the mlmic bird replies‚
And calls aloud for sack.

She next instructs him in the lissa
’Τίς now a little one, like llllss, .
And now a hearty smaell.
