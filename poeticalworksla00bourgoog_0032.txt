THE SONG ΟΕ THE uum curiosus. 13

'Ye rivers, bear his praise to every land,
Praise him, ye sees, by whose supreme command
Your greatest rage is bounded by the saud.
No bounds or limits are assigned you here,
Nor can your utmost forces go too iar.

Praise him, ye whales, arrd all the silver arsin,
Thai, on the fifth day made, the watery main
Withiu its spacious bosom does oontain:
His praise, ye fish, by you be always sung,
Tho· mute, to bless your Maker, find a tongue.

Praise him, ye fowls, exalt his name, whate'er
Or skims the water, or divides the air,
Who clothes arrd feeds you with paternai aare.
Repeai his praise to every echoing dale.
Ye morning lari, and eveniug nightingale.

Praise him, ye bessis, thar shady iorests sway,
Who seeds the lions roaring ior their prey,
Ye tamer kinds, that human force obey,
Presen. 'your praise, more grateful to the skies
Than thousands of you slain in sacrifice.

idore, ye sons of men, his awful name,
rho· form’d oi earth fili'd with etherisl flame,
{ast iu the noblest, and the finest frome.

Lei lordly man his sovereign's praise declaro,

And beauteous woman biess the aruiy ia‘u.
