My old wife's trinkets still hang jingling down,

The same the nodding of my steeple crown.

My pulse beats slow and dull, my teeth are gone,
Not one colt's tooth is left, not half a one.

Hair thinly scattered on my cheek there grows,
Where bloom’d the lily once, where blush'd the rose.

Nor yet accuse 1 Fate, or rail at Time,
Whose stealing years have spoil'd my former prime.
Your powerful smiles can gladsome youth restem
If you applaud her, nurse is old no more.

RESPUE QUOD NON ES.

Convivis inter superos, Vulcane, ministrans
Nectareos haustus cur male fundis humi?
Te decet AEtneis potius sudare caminiS,
Inter Cyclopas dum grave fervet opuS.
Sint manibus fabricata tuis data tela Tonanti;
Sint Ganymedea pocula mixta manu.
